This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Clone the repository into your local machine using git clone https://github.com/ayomideEnoch/google-search-homepage.

Ensure to run npm install or yarn install on your terminal once you have access to this folder on your code editor. This is because the node_modules folder (which is the heaviest folder created using create-react-app has numerous files estimated to be about 25,000 to 30,000 in number as at the time Ayomide Ibosiola wrote this code) is hidden in a .gitignore file placed in the root directory of the project when the code was pushed to GitHub. A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. GitHub avoids the pushing of such heavy folder to the repository and deals with it perfectly with the npm install / yarn install command. When this is done, all the dependencies required for the project to run are downloaded in a newly created node_modules folder, a package.json file and a package-lock.json file.

Run npm start or yarn start on your ternminal afterwards depending on the package manager you are using.
